                android:text = "Evolution operates on genetic information that is passed to subsequent
generations. However, transmission of nonheritable information also
determines critical roles that influence behavior within and between
cells, organisms and populations. These responses are dependent upon or
influenced by underlying genetic information, and decoding in many cases is
complex and affected by external conditions. For example, biological rhythms,
mating behaviors, flowering, animal communications and social structures
are dependent on and elicited by external signals and may encompass a range
of responses and behaviors.
\n\nOrgan systems have evolved that sense and process external information to
facilitate and enhance survival, growth and reproduction in multicellular
organisms. These include sensory systems that monitor and detect physical
and chemical signals from the environment and other individuals in the
population and that influence an animal’s well-being. The nervous system
interacts with sensory and internal body systems to coordinate responses
and behaviors, ranging from movement to metabolism to respiration. Loss
of function and coordination within the nervous system often results in
severe consequences, including changes in behavior, loss of body functions
and even death.
\n\nKnowledge and understanding of the structures and functions of
the nervous system are needed to understand this coordination. The
features of an animal’s nervous system are evolutionarily conserved,
with the basic cellular structure of neurons the same across species. The
physiological and cellular processes for signal formation and propagation
involve specialized membrane proteins, signaling molecules and ATP.
Neurological signals can operate and coordinate responses across
significant distances within an organism. The brain serves as a master
neurological center for processing information and directing responses,
and different regions of the brain serve different functions. Structures
and associated functions for animal brains are products of evolution, and
increasing complexity follows evolutionary lines.
\n\nPopulations of organisms exist in communities. Individual behavior influences
population behavior, and both are the products of information recognition,
processing and transmission. Communication among individuals within a
population may increase the long-term success of the population. Cooperative
behavior within a population provides benefits to the population and to the
individuals within the population. Examples of benefits include protection
from predators, acquisition of prey and resources, sexual reproduction,
recognition of offspring and genetic relatedness, and transmission of learned
responses.

                android:text="a. Organisms exchange information with each other in response to
internal changes and external cues, which can change behavior. Examples include:
\n• Fight or flight response
\n• Predator warnings
\n• Protection of young
\n• Plant-plant interactions due to herbivory
\n• Avoidance responses
\n\nb. Communication occurs through various mechanisms.
\n1. Living systems have a variety of signal behaviors or cues that
produce changes in the behavior of other organisms and can result
in differential reproductive success. For example, flower coloration can trick bees into pollinating the flower instead of female bees, leading to the spread of the flower.
\n2. Animals use visual, audible, tactile, electrical and chemical
signals to indicate dominance, find food, establish territory and
ensure reproductive success. Examples include:
\n• Bee dances
\n • Birds songs
\n • Territorial marking in mammals
\n • Pack behavior in animals
\n • Herd, flock, and schooling behavior in animals
\n • Predator warning
\n • Colony and swarming behavior in insects
\n • Coloration
\n\nc. Responses to information and communication of information are
vital to natural selection and evolution.
\n1. Natural selection favors innate and learned behaviors that
increase survival and reproductive fitness. Examples include:
\n• Parent and offspring interactions
\n• Migration patterns
\n• Courtship and mating behaviors
\n• Foraging in bees and other animals
\n• Avoidance behavior to electric fences, poisons, or traps
\n2. Cooperative behavior tends to increase the fitness of the
individual and the survival of the population. Examples include:
\n• Pack behavior in animals
\n• Herd, flock and schooling behavior in animals
\n• Predator warning
\n• Colony and swarming behavior in insects

                android:text="a. The neuron is the basic structure of the nervous system that reflects
function.
\n1. A typical neuron has a cell body, axon and dendrites. Many
axons have a myelin sheath that acts as an electrical insulator.
\n2. The structure of the neuron allows for the detection, generation,
transmission and integration of signal information.
\n3. Schwann cells, which form the myelin sheath, are separated by
gaps of unsheathed axon over which the impulse travels as the
signal propagates along the neuron.
\n\nb. Action potentials propagate impulses along neurons.
\n1. Membranes of neurons are polarized by the establishment of
electrical potentials across the membranes.
\n2. In response to a stimulus, Na+ and K+ gated channels
sequentially open and cause the membrane to become locally
depolarized.
\n3. pumps, powered by ATP, work to maintain membrane
potential.
\n\nc. Transmission of information between neurons occurs across
synapses.
\n1. In most animals, transmission across synapses involves
chemical messengers called neurotransmitters. Some neurotransmitters include (make sure you know the very basic functions of these):
\n• Acetylcholine
\n• Epinephrine
\n• Norepinephrine
\n• Dopamine
\n• Serotonin
\n• GABA
\n2. Transmission of information along neurons and synapses
results in a response.
\n3. The response can be stimulatory or inhibitory.
\n\nd. Different regions of the vertebrate brain have different functions.
\n• Forebrain (cerebrum), midbrain (brainstem) and hindbrain
(cerebellum)
\n• Right and left cerebral hemispheres in humans"/>
