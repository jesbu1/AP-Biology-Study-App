            android:text="Living systems require free energy and matter to maintain order, grow
and reproduce. Organisms employ various strategies to capture, use and
store free energy and other vital resources. Energy deficiencies are not only
detrimental to individual organisms; they also can cause disruptions at the
population and ecosystem levels.\n\n
Autotrophic cells capture free energy through photosynthesis and
chemosynthesis. Photosynthesis traps free energy present in sunlight
that, in turn, is used to produce carbohydrates from carbon dioxide.
Chemosynthesis captures energy present in inorganic chemicals. Cellular
respiration and fermentation harvest free energy from sugars to produce
free energy carriers, including ATP. The free energy available in sugars
drives metabolic pathways in cells. Photosynthesis and respiration are
interdependent processes.
\n\nCells and organisms must exchange matter with the environment. For
example, water and nutrients are used in the synthesis of new molecules;
carbon moves from the environment to organisms where it is incorporated
into carbohydrates, proteins, nucleic acids or fats; and oxygen is necessary
for more efficient free energy use in cellular respiration. Differences in
surface-to-volume ratios affect the capacity of a biological system to obtain
resources and eliminate wastes. Programmed cell death (apoptosis) plays a
role in normal development and differentiation (e.g. morphogenesis).
\n\nMembranes allow cells to create and maintain internal environments that
differ from external environments. The structure of cell membranes results in
selective permeability; the movement of molecules across them via osmosis,
diffusion and active transport maintains dynamic homeostasis. In eukaryotes,
internal membranes partition the cell into specialized regions that allow
cell processes to operate with optimal efficiency. Each compartment or
membrane-bound organelle enables localization of chemical reactions.
\n\nOrganisms also have feedback mechanisms that maintain dynamic
homeostasis by allowing them to respond to changes in their internal and
external environments. Negative feedback loops maintain optimal internal
environments, and positive feedback mechanisms amplify responses.
Changes in a biological systemâ€™s environment, particularly the availability
of resources, influence responses and activities, and organisms use various
means to obtain nutrients and get rid of wastes. Homeostatic mechanisms
across phyla reflect both continuity due to common ancestry and change
due to evolution and natural selection; in plants and animals, defense
mechanisms against disruptions of dynamic homeostasis have evolved.
Additionally, the timing and coordination of developmental, physiological
and behavioral events are regulated, increasing fitness of individuals and
long-term survival of populations."
